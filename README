This project deals with image pyramids, low-pass and band-pass filtering, and their application in image
blending. In this project I construct Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, use these to implement
pyramid blending, and finally compare the blending results when using different filters in the various
expand and reduce operations.

Image Pyramids
• Gaussian & Laplacian pyramid construction of a given image.
• Laplacian pyramid reconstruction of an image from its Laplacian Pyramid.
• Pyramid display, facilitate the display of pyramids, implement the following two functions:
• Pyramid Blending of 2 images.
